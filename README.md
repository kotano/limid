#### Description

Limid notes when you visit sites on the blocklist and takes up your `free time` until you go to another page. When you don't visit distracting pages, your time recovers, but at a slower pace. If you run out of free time, Limid blocks access to distracting pages and asks you to wait until the time is restored.
This approach is much better psychologically, since access is not blocked until the next day, but only for a short time, and even if you have recovered 5 minutes, you can turn off the blocking and continue browsing, but only for 5 minutes.
